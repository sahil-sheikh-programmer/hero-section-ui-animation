# Hero Section UI Animation – Frontend Coding Test

## Objective
This project was created as part of a frontend coding test to recreate a modern, visually appealing hero section inspired by the Skyriss website. The objective is to demonstrate UI/UX understanding, animation logic, responsiveness, and clean frontend implementation.

## 📌 Task 2 — Hero Section with Floating / Rotating Elements

### Reference
- Skyriss – Main Hero Section  
  https://www.skyriss.com/en

---

## ✨ Features Implemented
- Bold hero headline with supporting sub-text
- Subtle gradient background inspired by modern fintech websites
- Central 3D-style card/logo with:
  - Continuous rotation animation
  - Hover-based floating interaction for depth effect
- Multiple floating currency / coin icons surrounding the central element
- Smooth entrance animations on page load
- Interactive hover animations for enhanced user experience
- Fully responsive layout across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- **React**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion / Motion** (for animations and transitions)

---

## 🎯 Animation & Design Reasoning
- The central card uses rotation and hover transforms to create a 3D visual effect
- Floating elements use subtle oscillating animations to maintain a clean, modern feel
- Animations are intentionally smooth and minimal to align with fintech UI standards
- Framer Motion is used for performance-efficient animations and clean logic
- Focus was placed on clarity, balance, and visual hierarchy

---

## 📱 Responsiveness
- Layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes
- Floating elements reposition and scale appropriately on smaller devices
- Animations remain smooth and consistent across viewports
